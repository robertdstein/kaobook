\emph{Multi-wavelength astronomy} seeks to understand the universe through correlations between photons of different energies. \emph{Multi-messenger astronomy} expands this concept to also incorporate information from non-photon messengers, namely \emph{cosmic rays}, \emph{gravitational waves} and \emph{neutrinos}. Each messenger provides a unique view of astrophysical processes in objects.

\section{Cosmic Rays}

\emph{Cosmic Rays} were first discovered by Victor Hess in 1912, when the measured rate of ionising radiation was found to increase as a function of altitude, indicating the existence of an extraterrestrial flux `ionising rays' with a cosmic origin \sidecite{Hess:1912srp}. The name turned out to be a misnomer, because cosmic rays are now known to actually consist of charged particle rather than rays. This has ultimately made studying cosmic rays more challenging, because such charged particles are deflected by the many magnetic fields in the universe. Thus, while we can now detect cosmic rays with relatively high precision, their arrival direction does not reveal much about their origin.

An industry of experiments have developed since the Hess balloon expeditions to measure the composition and spectrum of Cosmic Rays, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CR_spectrum}. The data is well-described by an unbroken power-law up to $\sim$1 PeV, beyond which there is a spectral softening known as \emph{the knee}. This softer spectrum continues before undergoing a hardening, known as the \emph{ankle}. There is then evidence of a high-energy cutoff, sometimes dubbed \emph{the second knee} in a case of metaphor-stretching.

\begin{figure}
	\centering \includegraphics{mma/The_CR_Spectrum_2020}
	\caption{Cosmic Ray spectrum above 1 GeV, from \cite{evoli_carmelo_2020_4396125}.}
	\label{fig:CR_spectrum}
\end{figure}

The knee is typically identified as the point at which cosmic rays transition from being predominantly galactic to extragalactic, with the ankle component being fully extragalactic. The origin of the high-energy cutoff is unclear, and the corresponding flux is so low that detector arrays must cover several hundred square kilometers to study this regime with high statistics. Events with energies >10$^{18}$ eV are named \emph{Ultra-high energy cosmic rays} (UHECRs), and today these UHECRs are primarily studied by the \emph{Pierre Auger Detector} and \emph {Telescope Array} detector. This UHECR regime is particularly interesting, because it is the point at which the so-called \emph{GZK mechanism} would begin to suppress the cosmic ray flux \sidecite{greisen_66, zk_66}. 

In general, accelerated hadrons can interact through \emph{photohadronic} (p$\gamma$) nuclear interaction to produce pions via a resonant $\Delta$ baryon:

\begin{equation}
	p + \gamma \rightarrow \Delta^{+} \rightarrow n + \pi^{+}
	\label{eq:GZK_pip}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	p + \gamma \rightarrow \Delta^{+} \rightarrow p + \pi^{0}
	\label{eq:GZK_pi0}
\end{equation}

The GZK mechanism is a specific case of pion production where cosmic rays interact with ambient Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), so $\gamma = \gamma_{CMB}$. Given that the CMB photon spectrum is fixed, Equations \ref{eq:GZK_pip} and \ref{eq:GZK_pi0} would lead to a cutoff, in which pion production suppresses ultra-high energies above a threshold energy set by the mass of the $\Delta$ resonance. Attenuation would not occur for nearby cosmic ray sources, so the presence of such a cutoff would be evidence of an \emph{extragalatic origin} for UHECRs. 

However, the \emph{Cosmic Ray Composition} determines the exact threshold for the GZK cutoff, with the GZK limit scaling linearly with nuclear mass number of the cosmic ray\cite{spurio_18}. There is thus much focus on understanding whether UHECRs are proton-dominated or include a substantial iron component, with the latter case implying a much higher cutoff threshold. A joint working group considered the recent composition measurements of PAO and TA, and concluded that they are compatible once systematic uncertainties are accounted for \sidecite{pa_ta_17}. In general, these results support a light (proton-dominated) composition up to $\sim$10$^{19}$ GeV, above which PAO data favours a transition to a more mixed composition \sidecite{pao_composition_17}. 

An alternative explanation for any apparent cutoff is that sources of UHECRs simply cannot accelerate particles beyond certain energies due to physical constraints. In general, any cosmic ray accelerator must at a minimum satisfy the \emph{Hillas Criterion} that any particle can be contained during the acceleration process \sidecite{1984ARA&A..22..425H}. This can be calculated by equating the Lamour Radius of a particle with the physical size of an accelerator:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{E_{\textup{max}}}{\textup{PeV}} \approx
	1600 \times \frac{B}{\textup{Gauss}} \times \frac{R}{10^{16} \textup{cm}} \times
	\beta Z
	\label{eq:hillas}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:hillas} leads to a constraint on minimal magnetic field strength and source extension, which can be illustrated by a \emph{Hillas Plot} such as that in Figure \ref{fig:hillas_plot}. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering \includegraphics{mma/hillas}
	\caption{A Hillas plot illustrating possible cosmic-ray accelerators, from \cite{hillas_plot_19}.}
	\label{fig:hillas_plot}
\end{figure}

The Hillas criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a given source class to produce cosmic rays at the specified energy. The sources must also be capable of accelerating cosmic rays to the necessary energy in the first place, and the timescale for this to occur must also be shorter than the associated particle cooling timescale. Dedicated modelling of a given object is used to determine whether this criteria can be met.

High-energy cosmic rays are generally though to be produced from \emph{Fermi acceleration}. Fermi acceleration is premised on the idea of `magnetic mirrors', where elastic collisions with a magnetic field leads to the deflection of a charged particle \sidecite{spurio_18}. Such magnetic fields can be generated by clouds of interstellar material, with higher density than the surrounding area \cite{spurio_18}. The scenario is also referred to as a \emph{collisionless shock}, because the shock wave scattering length is substantially smaller than the typical particle mean free path, meaning that direct particle collisions are not the main interaction process in Fermi Acceleration \cite{spurio_18}. 

The dominant process is thought to be \emph{First Order Fermi Acceleration}, in which acceleration occurs through repeated reflections between two magnetic fields moving closer together \sidecite{fermi_54}. Many astrophysical accelerator models invoke \emph{diffusive shock acceleration}, where first order Fermi acceleration occurs in regions with strong shocks and small-scale turbulence \cite{spurio_18}.

Another contributor is \emph{Second Order Fermi Acceleration}, through which particles can be accelerated by collisions with moving magnetic fields \sidecite{fermi_49}. If the trajectory of magnetic fields were distributed randomly, collisions would preferentially occur with those trajectories moving towards the particle, and in each such collision the particle would gain energy.

In any case, accelerated particles have a probability to escape after each collision, with more collisions required for particles to reach higher energies, meaning that all Fermi acceleration leads to a characteristic power law with E$^{-\gamma}$ spectrum \sidecite{longair_11}. The exact index depends on the ratio of acceleration timescale to escape timescale, but is generally found to be $ \gamma \approx$ 2. 

\section{Neutrinos}

The electron neutrino was first proposed as a particle by Pauli in 1930 as a solution to understand the mechanics of beta decay \sidecite{pauli_33}. Though observations suggested that the process involved a three-body decay, only the charged electron and proton could be measured. Invoking the existence of a light, chargeless particle provided a theoretical escape route:

\begin{equation}
	n \rightarrow p + e^{-} + \nu_{e}
\end{equation}

 However, this particle was proven to be more than a theoretical construct, with its existence confirmed via direct detection of \emph{beta capture} in 1956 \sidecite{cowan_56}. In parallel, the \emph{Standard Solar Model} was developed over the course of the 20th century, which correctly identified that the sun was powered by nuclear fusion \sidecite{bethe_39}. This model came with a firm prediction of a guaranteed flux of electron anti-neutrinos, \emph{solar neutrinos}, which would be produced in tandem with thermal radiation. The first attempt to measure the solar neutrino flux was by the Homestake experiment in 1964 via Cl$^{37} \rightarrow$ Ar $^{37}$, which unexpectedly detected a flux that was only one third the predicted level \sidecite{davis_68}. This deficit, dubbed the \emph{solar neutrino problem}, was subsequently confirmed by many other experiments.

The solar neutrino problem was finally resolved in 2001, when the electron neutrino deficit was conclusively matched with a corresponding excess of muon neutrinos \sidecite{sno_01}. This confirmed the presence of \emph{neutrino oscillations}, by which neutrinos can change flavour states. To undergo oscillations, neutrinos must have different non-zero mass states, in contrast to previous assumptions in the Standard Model of particle physics. 

A new generation of experiments have developed to probe neutrino flavour oscillations across a range of energies, distance baselines and detection channels. In general, \emph{reactor neutrinos} are used to probe electron neutrino disappearance, while solar neutrinos are used to probe muon neutrino appearance. Only the difference in squared masses can be probed by these experiments, so while it is known that mass states 1 and 2 have a difference of $\sim7.4 \times 10^{-5}$ eV$^{2}$, and that mass states 1 and 3  have a difference of $\sim$2.5 $\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^{2}$ \sidecite{esteban_20}, the absolute ordering could be either \emph{normal ordering} (m1<m2<m3) or \emph{inverted ordering} (m3<m1<m2). Directly measuring these masses remains a particle physics aim, with recent results from KATRIN probing the sub-eV regime with a limit of m$_{\nu}$ < 0.8 eV at 90\% confidence \sidecite{katrin_21}. 

Solar neutrinos are not the only class of extraterrestrial neutrinos. In 1987, experiments studying the solar neutrino problem unexpectedly measured a simultaneous excess in neutrinos. This detection occurred shortly before the discovery of a nearby supernova in the \emph{Large Magellanic Clouds} (nearby dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way), and coincided with the core-collapse of that supernova \sidecite{sn1987a_neutrino}. These \emph{supernova neutrinos} were the first that could be cleanly identified as arising from beyond our solar system, and confirmed the essential \emph{neutrino cooling} that occurs during the stellar core collapse (see also Chapter \ref{ch:sources}). This was also the first example of astronomy with multiple messengers. Only nearby galactic supernovae produce a sufficiently large flux to be clearly identified against detector backgrounds. However, the predicted diffuse supernova neutrino background will soon be within reach of experiments.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics{mma/nu_spectrum}
	\caption{The full spectrum of neutrinos, from all sources. Credit: IceCube}
	\label{fig:nu_spectrum}
\end{figure}

For this thesis, the most relevant neutrino range occurs at ``higher'' GeV-PeV energies, where interactions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere should produce a guaranteed flux of \emph{atmospheric neutrinos}. This regime is probed by km$^{3}$-scale neutrino telescopes such as IceCube (see Chapter \ref{ch:icecube}. Such instruments detect neutrinos via \emph{charged current} (CC) and \emph{neutral current} (NC) interactions of the weak force. CC interactions are mediated by W$^{\pm}$ bosons:

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{l} + N \rightarrow W^{\pm} \rightarrow l^{\pm} + X
\end{equation}

while NC interactions are instead mediated by Z bosons:

\begin{equation}
	\nu_{l} + \rightarrow Z \rightarrow \nu_{l} + X
\end{equation}

where l is a lepton family (e, $\mu$, $\tau$), N is a nucleon and X represents the daughter hadronic particles \cite{spurio_18}. Neutrinos are then detected indirectly via the electromagnetic signature associated with the lepton l or hadrons X, typically via the \emph{Cherenkov effect}. 

With this technique, the flux of atmospheric neutrinos was first confirmed observationally with the AMANDA neutrino telescope in 2002 \sidecite{amanda_02}. This flux has since been measured with high precision by successor experiments such as IceCube, and extends over many orders of magnitude, as can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:ic_diffuse_flux} and \ref{fig:nu_spectrum}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering \includegraphics{icecube/ic_diffuse_flux}
	\caption{The astrophysical, atmospheric and prompt neutrino fluxes, from \cite{ic_15_joint}.}
	\label{fig:ic_diffuse_flux}
\end{figure}

In the same energy range, a flux of \emph{astrophysical neutrinos} (high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources) is to some degree guaranteed as a byproduct of high-energy cosmic ray production, resulting via pion production from the interaction of cosmic rays with ambient matter (pp) and radiation (p$\gamma$). In addition to the photohadronic interactions introduced in Equation \ref{eq:GZK_pip}, simple collisions between accelerated protons can also lead to pion production in a process analogous to fixed-target accelerator experiments:

\begin{equation}
	p + p \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}, \pi^{0}, p, n, ...
	\label{eq:pp}
\end{equation}

where higher-mass baryons and hadrons can also be produced \cite{spurio_18}. In general the daughter pions from Equation \ref{eq:pp} will follow a characteristic power law inherited from the parent proton spectrum. Regardless of the production mechanism, charged pions will ultimately decay to muons, generating muon neutrinos:

\begin{equation}
	\pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \nu_{\nu} + \mu^{\pm}
\end{equation}

These muons will further decay to electrons, generating two additional neutrinos:

\begin{equation}
	\pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu} + \mu^{\pm} \rightarrow \nu_{\nu} + \nu_{\mu} + \nu_{e} + e^{\pm}
\end{equation}

However, the extent of astrophysical neutrino production depends very substantially on the conditions at cosmic ray accelerators, with high fluxes requiring abundant target material for pion production. A flux of astrophysical neutrinos was first discovered by IceCube in 2013 \sidecite{ic_astro_13}, at a level close to the maximal one allowed by cosmic ray measurements \sidecite{waxman_bahcall_98}. As can be seen from the latest flux measurement in Figure \ref{fig:ic_diffuse_flux}, this astrophysical component begins to dominate over the atmospheric neutrinos above $\sim$100 TeV. No neutrino source class has yet been detected at the 5$\sigma$ level, but possible sources of these astrophysical neutrinos are discussed further in Chapter \ref{ch:sources}. With the detection of astrophysical tau neutrinos, IceCube has also provided the first evidence of neutrino oscillations over astronomical baselines \sidecite{stachurska_thesis}.

It is expected that there should be a distinct second atmospheric component of \emph{charm} or \emph{prompt atmospheric neutrinos}, generated from the decay of charm mesons which are produced through interactions of cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei \cite{spurio_18}. This component has not yet been measured, but as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ic_diffuse_flux} it remains subdominant relative to the astrophysical flux.

At the very highest energies, it is expected that the impact of the GZK cutoff (Equations \ref{eq:GZK_pip}) should generate a flux of neutrinos through interactions of UHECRs with the cosmic microwave background. These \emph{Cosmogenic Neutrinos} have not yet been observed, but upcoming radio neutrino observatories in particular are seeking to measure them. The flux of cosmogenic neutrinos depends very strongly on the composition, density and evolution of cosmic ray sources, so it remains unclear whether it will be accessible to these detectors.

\section{Photons}

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics{mma/multiwavelength_sky_full}
	\caption{The sky, in galactic coordinates. From top: radio, infra-red, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray. Credit: NASA}
	\label{fig:mwsky}
\end{marginfigure}

Photon astronomy, in particular that in optical wavelengths, is the oldest branch of astronomy. As clear in Figure \ref{fig:mwsky}, our own galaxy is the most obvious structure at all wavelengths. The different pictures of the galaxy are also noteworthy. One example is dust extinction obscuring a large portion of the optical emission (middle panel), but which is reprocessed to yield a particularly clear infra-red image (upper middle panel). This is an illustration of one broader principle, that interpolation between different photon energies can reveal additional information about astrophysical objects.

In general, photon emission can be divided into two broad classes, \emph{thermal emission} and \emph{non-thermal emission}. Thermal emission is approximate black-bodies, and produces characteristic spectra. Non-thermal emission arises from particle acceleration, and is typically characterised by power-law emission. Objects can have both components. Thermal emission is typically centred in IR, optical or UV wavelengths, while non-thermal emission is typically extends from low energies (radio) to high-energies (hard X-rays and gamma-rays). Photons from a source can often only be understood by considering the full \emph{Spectral Energy Distribution} (SED) of that object, with components at different wavelengths originating from different physical processes.
 
 \subsection*{Thermal Photons}
 
 \emph{Thermal photons} are those produced by \emph{blackbody radiation}, which have a characteristic form described in \emph{Planck's Law}:
 
 \begin{equation}
 	B(\nu, T)  \equiv \frac{dE}{dt d\nu dA d\Omega} = \frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c^{2}} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_{b}T} -1}
 \end{equation}

where B is the \emph{Spectral radiance} of the source, $\nu$ is the frequency, and T is the temperature \sidecite{planck_01}. By integrating over the full solid angle, and accounting for redshifting (see Chapter \ref{ch:nu_cosmology}), the observed flux on Earth can be parameterised as:

 \begin{equation}
F_{\lambda}(\lambda, T, R, D_{L})	\equiv \frac{dE}{dt d\lambda dA}  = (1 + z) \times \frac{R^{2}}{D_{L}^{2}} \times \frac{2 \pi h c^{3}}{\lambda^{5}} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/k_{b}T} -1}
\end{equation}

where R is the radius of the object, and $D_{L}$ is the luminosity distance to it, and z is the object redshift. Many of the astrophysical population introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:sources}, such as \emph{supernovae} or \emph{tidal disruption events} can be well described by such thermal spectra. With observations in multiple bands, such as optical, IR and UV, the physical properties of a source can be inferred at different observation epochs. 

Most astrophysical populations have temperatures >10$^{3}$ K and <10$^{5}$ K, meaning that a substantial fraction of the thermal emission in in the sensitive range of optical telescopes such as ZTF (see Chapter \ref{ch:ztf}). Surveys at these wavelengths are well-suited to first identify such objects for use e.g in neutrino astronomy, even though this thermal emission is unrelated to the hadronic processes which accelerate particles. Having found these objects, their neutrino emission can then be studied e.g with dedicated likelihood analysis as introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:llh}. In any case, the thermal emission of such objects provides an estimate of the source bolometric luminosity, giving a scale for energy output, and also an approximate model for the photon field in the source.

 \subsection*{Spectroscopy}

While photon observations are typically integrated over relatively-wide range of wavelengths, additional information can be gleaned from \emph{high-resolution spectroscopy}, in which emission in fine wavelength bins can be analysed. In general, light is quantised in the form of photons where:

\begin{equation}
	E(\nu) = h \nu
	\label{eq:planck}
\end{equation}

As a consequence of quantum mechanics, electrons in atoms occupy discrete energy levels, yielding a limited number of possible energy transitions. Incident photons with energy matching these discrete steps can excite an electron via  the \emph{photoelectric effect} \sidecite{einstein_photoelectric_1905}, absorbing the photon in the process. Light passing through a cloud of material will thus develop \emph{absorption features}, which are spectrum deficits at frequencies corresponding to the step energies. Absorption features typically occur in cold material, so usually arise from matter lying along the line of sight between photon source and observer.

Alternatively, when atoms are excited, photons will instead be emitted at these step energies. Such excitation often occurs at the astrophysical photon sources. This leads to \emph{emission lines} in a spectrum, which can be used to infer the chemical composition of astrophysical objects. The exact energy is fixed by differing electron energy levels, and this produces a characteristic sequence of emission lines at different energies corresponding to different energy transitions. The most abundant group are the \emph{Hydrogen lines}, alternatively named the \emph{Balmer series}.

Identified emission lines can be used to infer \emph{redshift}, by comparing the observed wavelength of emission to the expected one, giving a measurement of distance to astrophysical objects. It can also be used for classification, with the temporal evolution of emission lines being the prime method to distinguish astrophysical populations. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering \includegraphics{mma/spectroscopy}
	\caption{An example spectrum, from AT2019dsg.}
	\label{fig:spectrum}
\end{figure}

An example spectrum is shown in Figure \ref{fig:spectrum}, of TDE \emph{AT2019dsg} at 33 days post optical peak (see Chapter \ref{ch:bran}). The Balmer series is clearly visible, consisting of three peaks including a very prominent \emph{H$\alpha$ line}. From the observed wavelength of these lines, a redshift of z=0.051 can be inferred. With known redshift, other common emission lines associated with TDEs can then be identified, namely HeII, OII and NIII, indicating the respective presence of Helium, Nitrogen and Oxygen. These emission lines are then superimposed on a \emph{blue continuum} (a flux baseline which is higher at the "bluer"/shorter wavelengths), in common with most other TDEs. This continuum arises from the thermal emission, and indicates that the object is `hot', or `blue', because the blackbody emission peaks at shorter wavelengths than for the sun. Finally \emph{telluric lines} (atmospheric absorption lines) are visible, marked by a cross. 

 \subsection*{Non-Thermal Photons}
 
\emph{Non-thermal photons} are those produced by accelerated particles through various cooling processes. Given its connection to accelerated charged particles, this non-thermal emission is most relevant for identifying sources of cosmic rays and neutrinos. Inherited from the parent particle population, non-thermal emission is often characterised by power-law energy spectra.

\emph{Synchrotron radiation} is generated by populations of charged particles moving through magnetic fields, most commonly electrons. Given that the parent spectrum will often follow a power law arising from Fermi acceleration up to a maximum energy, the synchrotron radiation will also follow a power law up to a corresponding \emph{peak frequency}. Synchrotron emission scales with $\sim$E$_{e}^{2}$, modifying the observed flux spectral index relative to the parent one. Above the peak frequency, the lack of higher-energy electrons will lead to an exponential suppression of flux, with this break typically appearing somewhere in the IR, optical, UV or X-ray bands.

At lower energies, these synchrotron photons can be reabsorbed by the electrons, a process known as \emph{Synchrotron self-absorption} (SSA). SSA leads to a suppression in the observed synchrotron flux at Earth up to a \emph{Synchrotron self-absorption frequency} which depends primarily on magnetic field strength, above which the synchrotron emission is detected unattenuated. For electrons, this transition usually occurs at radio frequencies. Synchrotron spectra at radio wavelengths are thus well-described by broken power law models with a characteristic SSA spectral break, with the break frequency and power law indices then being used to infer the physical properties of the synchrotron-emitting region.  This procedure of particular relevance to this thesis (see Chapter \ref{ch:bran}).  phase space for interaction decreases with e of the photon

Non-thermal electrons will also generate photons at higher energies, leading to \emph{leptonic gamma-rays}. High-energy photons can be generated by \emph{Inverse Compton Scattering} (IC), in which the electrons scatter off photons and transfer energy:

\begin{equation}
	e^{-} + \gamma \rightarrow e^{-} + \gamma'
\end{equation}

where outgoing photon energy, $\gamma'$, is larger than the incoming photon energy $\gamma$. In general, extensive leptonic gamma-ray emission can be produced in astrophysical objects through \emph{Synchrotron Self-Compton} (SSC) mechanism. In this case, an accelerated population of electrons generate abundant photons through synchrotron emission, and this same electron population then upscatters these photons to higher energies via the IC effect \sidecite{spurio_18}. Alternatively leptonic gamma-rays may be produced through IC scattering with photons from an \emph{external radiation field} (i.e not from the electrons themselves), for example thermal X-rays in AGN disks (see Chapter \ref{ch:sources}).

In addition to leptonic gamma-rays, \emph{hadronic gamma rays} are produced through the decay of neutral pions. Given that these $\pi^{0}$ are always produced alongside charged pions, neutrino production must always be accompanied by a flux of hadronic gamma-rays. In principle, this can provide a photon tracer for neutrino sources. The neutral pions generated in Equations \ref{eq:GZK_pi0} and \ref{eq:pp}, will subsequently decay to a photon pair:

\begin{equation}
	\pi_{0} \rightarrow \gamma + \gamma
\end{equation}

with the photon energy lying in the gamma-ray range. However, these can be subsequently absorbed, so neutrinos may be produced in seemingly gamma-dark sources. Just as for neutrinos, pp gamma-rays will follow a characteristic power law spectrum, while for p$\gamma$ the spectrum will be more peaked. 

In any case, even if gamma-rays escape their production site, they may not reach Earth. Above $\sim$TeV energies, gamma-rays are increasingly like to interact with photons from the \emph{Extragalactic Background Light} (EBL) which pervades the universe, leading to \emph{pair production}: 

\begin{equation}
	\gamma + \gamma_{EBL} \rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-} 
	\label{eq:gamma_ebl}
\end{equation}

Similar to the GZK cutoff, Equation \ref{eq:gamma_ebl} leads to \emph{EBL absorption} which strongly attenuates the TeV gamma-ray flux from more distant objects. The vast majority of detected TeV gamma-ray emitters are thus located in the galaxy and local universe.

One key challenge for gamma-ray astronomy is distinguishing between leptonic emission and hadronic emission. Hadronic models often assume that the pions are produced in \emph{proton synchrotron} scenarios, where the target photon field for pion production is assumed to be the synchrotron emission from the electrons which are co-accelerated with the protons. However, much like for leptonic models, external radiation fields can also be invoked to provide a photon target. In most cases, while lower energy (i.e radio) emission is generally leptonic, it is hard to distinguish between leptonic, hadronic or mixed lepto-hadronic emission at higher energies. Given this degeneracy, we cannot infer the existence of a flux of accompanying neutrinos merely because of a gamma-ray detection.

\section{Gravitational Waves}

Gravitational waves were proposed to exist by Einstein as a consequence of General Relativity in 1915 \sidecite{einstein_15, einstein_16}. The waves are propagating variations of space-time curvature, generated by massive systems with a varying \emph{quadripole moment} (rotating systems which are not spherically symmetric) \cite{spurio_18}. The impact of gravitational waves passing through an object is to temporarily modify the local spacetime curvature, leading to a possible detection method via deviations in light travel path. However the projected length deviation, $\delta_{l}$, would be proportional to the strain amplitude, h, of gravitational waves:

\begin{equation}
	\delta_{l} \approx h l \approx  \frac{h}{10^{-21}} \times \frac{l}{4 \textup{km}} \times 4 \times 10^{-18} \textup{m}
\end{equation}

where l is the light travel distance \sidecite{gw_review}, with even extreme waves estimated to generate strains of h $\lesssim$10$^{-17}$ at Earth. Various experiments tried measure to this signature of gravitational waves in the 20th century, beginning with Weber's resonant mass detectors in the 1960s probing strains of $\sim$10$^{-17}$ \sidecite{weber_60}, though none succeeded. 

The first indirect evidence for Gravitational waves came after the discovery of \emph{PSR J1915+1606}, the first pulsar binary \sidecite{hulse_taylor}. This binary system had an 8 hour orbital period that could be precisely measured in 1975, and could continue to be observed over the subsequent decades. The orbital period duration was seen to shorten over time, consistent with expectations from General Relativity for energy loss in the form of gravitational waves \sidecite{taylor_gr}. 

However, direct detection experiments have continued to develop, and are now substantially more sensitive. The \emph{Advanced LIGO} gravitational wave detectors are a pair of laser interferometers located at Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington,  constructed in 2015 \sidecite{ligo_detector_15}. Each interferometer has two arms of length 4 km, through which light is reflected 300 times to amplify variations, and at design sensitivity can detect strains of <10$^{-22}$ in the 30-3000 Hz frequency range. Gravitational wave detection in LIGO is generally performed either through \emph{template matching} to pre-simulated GW signals \sidecite{sathyaprakash_91}, or through a more agnostic algorithmic search for \emph{coherent wave bursts} via a time-frequency analysis \sidecite{cwb_16}. In general, the sensitivity of searches is enhanced through the coincident detection of signals in multiple GW detectors.

During the first observing run (O1) of Advanced LIGO in 2015, gravitational waves were first detected from a binary black hole merger (see also Chapter \ref{ch:sources}). As seen in Figure \ref{fig:gw150914}, the event, \emph{GW150914}, was detected simultaneously in both detectors at a significance of 5.1$\sigma$  \sidecite{ligo_bbh_16}. This was the first direct detection of gravitational waves, unambiguously confirming their existence. Moreover, this confirmed that astrophysical sources can generate high-amplitude GW signatures, in this case with the merger at $\sim400$ Mpc generating a peak strain of $\sim$10$^{-21}$.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering \includegraphics{mma/ligo_bbh}
	\caption{The detection of a binary black hole merger by LIGO, from \cite{ligo_bbh_16}.}
	\label{fig:gw150914}
\end{figure}

Numerous other astrophysical gravitational wave detections have since followed. However, of the many proposed astrophysical gravitational wave sources introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:sources}, only binary black holes mergers and binary neutron star mergers have so far been unambiguously detected \sidecite{lvc_gw170817}.  Much of the GW frequency space remains unexplored, because the lever arm size directly determines the sensitive frequency range of a detector. As introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:sources}, astrophysical signals expected at millihertz frequencies could only be tested with upcoming space-based interferometers such as \emph{Laser Interferometer Space Antenna} (LISA) planned for the 2030s \sidecite{lisa}.

An alternative method for direct gravitational wave detection also involves pulsars, namely the \emph{pulsar timing method} \sidecite{pulsar_gw_method}. In this case the `lever arm' is the distance to known pulsars, with passing gravitational waves being detected via the consequent deviation in pulsar cycles. The \emph{Interational Pulsar Timing Array} (IPTA) is the most comprehensive present effort to detect such emission, with sensitivity at nanohertz frequencies \sidecite{ipta}. No detection has yet been claimed from any such pulsar timing array.
