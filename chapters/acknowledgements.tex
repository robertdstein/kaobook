As for pretty much everyone else on the planet, COVID-19 ensured that 2020/21 was not quite the year I had planned. In the middle of a global pandemic, it has been hard enough just staying sane. I would like to thank everyone who helped me do that, whether with a socially-distanced game of \emph{Among Us} or \emph{Terraria}, a Zoom quiz or an evening \emph{coronabier} in Treptower Park.

Lastly, I would particularly like to thank my parents, with whom I spent a lot more time than expected while writing this thesis. A Covid-extended trip to London was just the latest instance of endless support. And Adam. I would also like to thank my brother Adam, who repaid a thesis-reading debt by  a substantially longer PhD thesis.
