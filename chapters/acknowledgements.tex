Marek?

I would particularly like to thank Alex Stasik, who first introduced my to IceCube point source analyses, and Thomas Kintscher, who patiently endured many months of stupid questions about IceCube. It's not easy being a senior PhD student while trying to write a thesis, but

As for pretty much everyone else on the planet, COVID-19 ensured that 2020/21 was not quite the year I had planned. In the middle of a global pandemic, it has been hard enough just staying sane. I would like to thank everyone who helped me do that in the last 12 months, whether with a socially-distanced coffee, a Zoom quiz or an evening beer in Treptower Park.

Lastly, I would particularly like to thank my parents, with whom I spent a lot more time than expected while writing this thesis. A short trip to London may have lasted  longer than any of us anticipated, but together we learned to adjust to life under lockdown. This is just the latest of countless times they have supported me.

And Adam.I would also like to thank my brother Adam, who repaid a thesis-reading debt by  a substantially longer PhD thesis.
